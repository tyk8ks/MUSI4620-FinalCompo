# MUSI4620-FinalCompo

-- open Compo 2 scene
For this final composition I used a couple different PD patches and scripts:

- c_chord: a simple c chord that I wanted playing underneath everything as a base
- SineEnvelope: which control the center petals and pulses
- test2: which is the backbone of the melody and counter melody in my piece

I also have two scripts that control the main musical elements called SimplePatchCtrl and melody, which are very similar but play in different octaves and notes, but at the same time. I put both of these at 10 speed so it is fairly fast, and then other objects have the melody patch but slower, which adds a bit of contrast.

As for the visuals, I made sure that all objects and the floor were reflective so that the lights I have circling can reflect off of the objects. I also have the main camera circling and facing the center, where the garden is. The lights and the main camera have the same script that are circling but at different speeds and radii. The garden is made up of the same object but arranged in a pattern so that it gives a mosaic look.
